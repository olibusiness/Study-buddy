This project is a simple and user-friendly Pomodoro Timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This timer allows users to customize the length of both the work and break intervals to fit their personal preferences.

I also designed a modern landing page. There is also room to include more study techniques

We hope you find this Pomodoro Timer helpful in managing your time and increasing productivity. Enjoy!
